Feature scaling and normalization:
to calculate the speradence of the data, we could use variable and stand deviation formula
Example of capital distribution

Unsupervised learning algorithm:
visualization is easy for data with only two dimension, but not for data with more than two dimensions
So we use two technique for clustering:
    k-means
    centroid:
        given center points and use data points:
                1: which points belong to it (c2)
                2: then belongs to cluseter of c2
                3: get the average of the points it (c2) contains. 
                    (x1+x2+...+xn)/n
                4: get the new center from the data clusters of c2
        to recalculate the a new center points from it by steps above.
